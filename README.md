This webpage is designed to show my knowledge of front web development languages and techniques. In the first version of this software, I used HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, the Angular framework, responsive web design, Angular Material UI as well as a stock API (https://financialmodelingprep.com/) to develop this site. I intend to add more in the near future!

This application has been tested in only Safari and Chrome.
